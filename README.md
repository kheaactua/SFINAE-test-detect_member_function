# SFINAE-test-detect_member_function

SFINAE is annoying.  Making a repo saving working examples of detecting a member function

The code here is mostly based on [SFINAE Hell: detecting template
methods](http://blog.quasardb.net/sfinae-hell-detecting-template-methods/)

This current branch does not compile with clang++ (so I didn't try the others)
